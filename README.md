## Getting Started

Open a terminal or console, navigate to the root directory, and run the following commands:

First install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
npm i
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Poppins, a custom Google Font.
